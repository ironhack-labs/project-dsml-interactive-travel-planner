Dorado is subdivided into five barrios and Dorado Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. During the early 18th century, there were already mentions of a \"Sitio de Dorado\" (meaning a golden place) in some San Juan registers. Since the beginning of the Spanish colonial period and until 1831, Dorado existed as a barrio (or ward) of the town of Toa Baja. Over several years, the ward grew and established its own town center called the \"new pueblo\" to differentiate itself from Toa Baja, which became known as the \"old pueblo.\" Over several years, the barrios that currently make up Dorado grew and the people of the \"new pueblo\" wanted to separate themselves from Toa Baja. On November 22, 1842, Jacinto López Martínez, the Sergeant at Arms for the ward of Dorado, petitioned the Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico, Santiago Méndez Vigo, to establish the municipality of Dorado. The governor authorized the founding of the town pending the construction of public works, including an administrative building and a church near the town square. In 1848, the construction of the public works were completed and López Martínez became the first mayor of Dorado. Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanishxe2x80x93American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1902, four years after the Spanishxe2x80x93American War, Dorado was again appended to Toa Baja. But in 1905 it regained its status as a separate town. Nowadays, Dorado has upscale neighborhoods and a small downtown area with a plaza (main town square), as other Puerto Rican municipalities. The town's patron saint is Anthony of Padua, and patron saint celebrations are held at the plaza every year on June 13.",

It is believed that the Taíno chief Jumacao was the first \"cacique\" to learn to read and write in Spanish, since he wrote a letter to the King of Spain Charles I complaining about how the Governor of the island wasn't complying with their peace agreement. In the letter, Jumacao argued that their people were virtually prisoners of Spain. It is said that King Charles was so moved by the letter that he ordered the Governor to obey the terms of the treaty.[self-published source]",

The cave system is found in one of the oldest karst zones in Puerto Rico. Cueva Oscura (Spanish for \"dark cave\") is home to the two largest cave rooms in the system. This cave is also considered an important bat habitat and is home to the most diverse and abundant bat colonies in the system.",

It mainly consists of mangrove coasts, keys and floodplain forests, and it borders the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. The Aguirre State Forest is owned and administered by Puerto Rico. It was established in 1918 by Puerto Rico governor Arthur Yager to protect the mangrove forests areas between the municipalities of Guayama and Santa Isabel (Punta Petrona). The state forest is named after the nearby Central Aguirre, a historic sugarcane plantation and refinery, and the barrio of Salinas of the same name. The forest is notable for its dense mangrove forests and salt ponds. As such it is an ecologically diverse area that is home to 13 species of reptiles, 4 species of amphibians and 3 species of bats. At least 184 bird species can be found within the forest and the area is an important bird nesting site. Some notable bird species found here are yellow-crowned night herons (Nyctanassa violacea), mangrove rails (Rallus longirostris), yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), and endangered birds such as yellow-shouldered blackbirds (Agelaius xanthomus). Manatees can also be observed in the lagoons located in and around the forest. The types of mangroves found within the state forest are white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus). Batis maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum and Sporobolus virginicus are the main grass species found in the area, particularly around the tropical salt ponds and keys.",

In 1936, during the Great Depression, the Casino declared bankruptcy and shut down. It subsequently had various uses: a postal office, a public health unit, tax collector's office, and even a temporary city hall. In 1990 it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government, and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His Majesty Felipe de Borbon, took place. Ponce had three casinos before this one. The first Casino de Ponce was founded in 1862, on Calle Marina. It met at the location that was later (in 1911) used by Rosendo Matienzo Cintron as his law office. The organization stopped meeting due to political quarrels between the two political factions in its membership representing groups for and against the government of Spanish General Sanz, but it reformed on 19 July 1876. This second Casino de Ponce was located on the second floor of the property owned by Don Carlos Cabrera Martinez, one of the distinguished members of the Ponce high society. Their meeting location was on an elegant structure at the northeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Cristina, facing Plaza Las Delicias. The third Casino de Ponce reformed on 29 June 1897.

The idea for the asylum for the poor began with a campaign to build it by Salvador Suau y Mulet when he was Mayor of Mayagxc3xbcez. This building is highly representative of the 19th century institutional architecture of Puerto Rico. The building was designed and built by commissioned state architects Manuel V. Domenech and Luis Perocier in 1895. The building as it stands today however was not fully completed until 1920 due to complications caused by the 1918 earthquake, after which it was restored and expanded. The institution was operated by the Sisters of Charity during its first years. For some time, Salvador Agrón, the inspiration for the Broadway musical The Capeman, lived in the building with his mother. In 1962 it became asylum for the elderly. The number of elderly patients increased, and, in 1967, occupational therapy and arts programs were added by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, they also run the laundry, cafeteria, pharmacy and others.",

In an area of 1,140 hectares (2,800 acres), the reserve contains five distinct habitat types and provides sanctuary to several endangered species. Bahía de Jobos is one of 28 reserves that comprise the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationxe2x80x99s (NOAA) National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The reserve is operated in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA). Jobos Bay is located on the south coast of Puerto Rico in Aguirre barrio, between Salinas and Guayama. Most of the land in the reserve is owned by a private company which leased the land to the Aguirre Corporation, which operated an extensive sugarcane farm and sugar mill in the region. After the burst of the sugar industry, Aguirre closed in 1980 and the land remains owned by the private corporation. The land has been offered to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico but because of financial troubles the purchase never concluded. The land remains under private ownership but part of the Bay is Federal Land. Bahía de Jobos was established as a National Estuarine Sanctuary in 1981. Jobos Bay private lands remains the only undeveloped bay lands in the entire island, consisting of close to 160 hectares (400 acres) and more than 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of frontage to the bay.

Used by the Tainos in the pre-Columbian era, the Baños were believed by many to have healing powers. The Baños became a popular tourist attraction among the early Spanish settlers which prompted the construction of a resort by local entrepreneurs. Coamo was the site of an important battle during the Puerto Rico Campaign of the Spanishxe2x80x93American War and were subject to artillery bombardments which damaged the resort. The historic Baños and resort were restored during the 20th century by the Government of Puerto Rico, becoming once more a popular tourist attraction. The Taino's who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus and the Spanish conquistadors were the first Europeans to discover the hot spring waters of Coamo. According to local legend, the first governor of Puerto Rico Juan Ponce de León, heard about the healing powers of the Baños from the Tainos. Believing that the baths were the Fountain of Youth which he was seeking, Ponce de Leon asked where they were located, however he misunderstood the instructions given to him and instead headed by sea towards a new land which resulted in the discovery of Florida and his death. During the mid-16th century the word spread among the Spanish settlers of the healing powers of the six sulfur-rich spring waters and as a consequence, many of the settlers began to make the regular journeys from San Juan to the mountainous region to enjoy what they believed were the benefits of said waters.",

They are commemorated on the feast day of Epiphanyxe2x80x94sometimes called \"Three Kings Day\"xe2x80x94and commonly appear in the nativity celebrations of Christmas. The Magi appear solely in the Gospel of Matthew, which states that they came \"from the east\" to worship the \"one who has been born king of the Jews\". Their names, origins, appearances, and exact number are unmentioned and derive from the inferences or traditions of later Christians. In Western Christianity, they are usually assumed to have been three in number, corresponding with each gift; in Eastern Christianity, especially the Syriac churches, they often number twelve. Likewise, the Magi's social status is never stated: Although some biblical translations describe them as astrologers, they were increasingly identified as kings by at least the third century, which conformed with Christian interpretations of Old Testament prophecies that the messiah would be worshipped by kings. The mystery of the Magi's identities and background, combined with their theological significance, has made them prominent figures in the Christian tradition; they are venerated as saints or even martyrs in many Christian communities, and are the subject of numerous artworks, legends, and customs. Both secular and Christian observers have noted that the Magi popularly serve as a means of expressing various ideas, symbols, and themes. Most scholars regard the Magi as legendary rather than historical figures.",

In 1901, then-Education Commissioner, Martin Grove Brumbaugh, initiated talks with Andrew Carnegie with the purpose of building a public library in San Juan, as part of the United States' Puerto Rican education program. For this, the San Juan municipal legislature had agreed to give $6,000 for maintenance expenses. Carnegie's private secretary, James Bertram, indicated that the amount usually donated was 10 times the promised maintenance expenses. Nevertheless, Brumbaugh obtained the $100,000 amount. This was in part due to then-Governor Arthur Yager's friendship with Carnegie himself. Its origins stem from the Insular Library created in 1903, created by the then-new civil government, which itself came from the military-rule era San Juan Free Library, which was a merger of five pre-existing libraries under Spanish-rule: the library of the Dominican and Franciscan monasteries, the Real Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País, the library of the Provincial Council [es] and Treasury Department of Puerto Rico, the library of the Royal College of Lawyers-General Secretary and the library of the Institute of Secondary Education and Normal School. It has a Classical Revival stylings and was designed and built by the Puerto Rican engineer Ramón Carbia in 1914, when work on the project commenced on land donated by the Puerto Rico government. In June 1916, the collection of the Insular Library, which had previously been known as the San Juan Public Library, was transferred to the building and the library, which was named Biblioteca Carnegie, itself was inaugurated on 27 July, when the Puerto Rican government formally accepted the donation. From 1917 till 2010, the library was administered by the Department of Education. In its first forty years of service the library had nine reading rooms, membership, with an average of 200 daily visitors. Under the 222 Law of 1946 a $6,000 amount was made available to the library's board of trustees, with the intent of establishing the Biblioteca Rodante (\"Library on Wheels\"). The then-Department of Public Instruction was authorized to organize and equip the Biblioteca Rodante, which offered it services through the use of cajas viajeras (\"travelling boxes\"), which were shelves used to carry books to isolated schools and communities. The project started in 1948 under the direction of Federico Porrata Doría, Francisco Porrata-Doría's brother, with two vehicles carrying books for children and adults, as users ranged from elementary-level school children to adults aged eighty to ninety-years old.",

While some beaches are predominantly made of black sand, even other color beaches (e.g. gold and white) can often have deposits of black sand, particularly after storms. Larger waves can sort out sand grains leaving deposits of heavy minerals visible on the surface of erosion escarpments. Black sands are used by miners and prospectors to indicate the presence of a placer formation. Placer mining activities produce a concentrate that is composed mostly of black sand. Black sand concentrates often contain additional valuables, other than precious metals: rare earth elements, thorium, titanium, tungsten, zirconium and others are often fractionated during igneous processes into a common mineral-suite that becomes black sands after weathering and erosion.",

Hikers and beachgoers are often seen in the island, which can be reached by ferry from the La Guancha Boardwalk sector of Ponce Playa. Together with Cardona, Ratones, Morrillito, Isla del Frio, Gatas, and Isla de Jueyes, Caja de Muertos is one of seven islands ascribed to the municipality of Ponce. It is believed the island is only some 4,000 years old, and stone art left on the island attests it has been visited by man over milennnia. Taíno natives made frequent trips to the island on fishing expeditions, and when they were defeated by the Spanish during the 1511 battle of Spanishxe2x80x93Taíno War for Borikén, the natives attempted a retreat to the Caja de Muertos but shortly afterwards they were either captured or killed. During much of the 17th century, the island is known to have been used as a hideout by pirates and mutineers. For example, in 1599-1600 it was used by a group merchants-turned-pirates who, after learning of a Portuguese ship filled with gold, silver, precious stones, other treasures, attacked it and appropriated its contents. As they attempted to travel back to England, though, they faced an attempted mutiny and, surviving it, they took refuge at Caja de Muertos. Venturing to the Puerto Rico mainland for provisions, they were killed, except for one, who later confessed to the existence of the hidden treasure. The Spanish colonial governor then appropriated the remaining treasure for construction projects among other uses.",

Located on San Juan Islet immediately outside the Walls of Old San Juan, the oceanfront, neoclassical Beaux-Arts-style, entirely white marble-covered edifice was constructed between 1921 and 1929 to resemble the ancient Roman Pantheon in Rome, using as inspiration the Low Memorial Library in New York City. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Prior to the establishment of the Capitol, the Legislative Assembly used the Provincial Delegation Building, which now houses the Department of State. The idea of constructing a capitol was first introduced by former Resident Commissioner Luis Muñoz Rivera in 1907, and was partly meant to demonstrate some degree of civilian rule in the island, which at the time was already a colony of the United States. The project proposed by Muñoz Rivera assigned $3 million for the construction and established rules for a contest among architectures to decide which one would do the work. In September 1907, Commissioner of the Interior Laurence Grahame sent the official request for architects through the press and magazines of United States. The specifications for the building were that it was supposed to have three principal installations: the Executive Council, the House of Delegates, and the Supreme Court. It was supposed to be simple, conservative, and appropriate to the island's weather conditions. 134 architectural designs were submitted from the US, Cuba, Canada, France, Spain, and Puerto Rico.",

The area was preserved with the intention of developing it for its timber industry. The state forest was established with the goal of protecting the hydrological basins of the Loíza, Patillas and La Plata rivers which were being affected by erosion caused by deforestation throughout the 20th century. In more recent times the forest has become an important wildlife preserve, ecological research site and recreational area. This forest is located within the Sierra de Cayey mountain range.

The building is of architectural significance for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornaments. The complete preservation of the original architecture of the Monsanto Residence, its unique design amongst the houses of Ponce, and its location within the historic urban core of the city qualify it as one of a series of grand houses and an integral part of the character of Ponce. The Monsanto Residence at Calle Castillo No.34 is an architectural landmark in the city of Ponce. Designed by the well-known architect Blas Silva in 1913, the residence stands out among the great houses of Ponce for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornament. Adapting the curves of the \"Art Nouveau\" to the persistent Neo-classicism of Puerto Rico and the recently born Creole vocabulary of Ponce, Silva succeeded in creating a movement in architecture which broke away from the traditional forms while remaining within them. The traditional continuous raised verandah along the front facade is broken up into two and twisted out of its usual linearity into the curved forms preserved today. Characteristic of the architecture to abound in Ponce contemporaneous to Castillo 34 is a profusion of appliqué, and eclectic combination and juxtaposition of shapes, particularly curvilinear, and a general ostentation of articulation. Blas Silva was probably the most established of the \"wedding-cake architects\" and was thus sought after mostly by the \"nouveau riche\" of the period. Silva's houses are among the richest in Ponce, among which the Monsanto Residence stands put for its circular porches. Other buildings by Blas Silva include the Frau Residence and the Salazar-Candal Residence, both also listed in the NRHP.",

In addition to its political and historical value, the structure is a good example of the Creole residential architecture of the interior of the island of Puerto Rico at that time. The house is characterized by the simplicity of its architectural components and by the use of wood, both in the structure as in the details. Its plant is rectangular in shape and has a pitched roof. The main facade stands on a podium, and consists of a balcony adorned by a continuous balustrade and four columns that support the roof of the balcony. In 1959, it was restored and transformed into a library-museum by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture.",

The historic building is located at 47 Salud Street, in the city's historic district, at the northwest corner of Salud and Aurora streets. The house is also known as Casa del Abogado (House of the Attorney). In April 2019, the house was turned into Casa Mujer by MedCentro, a women's health business concern. The Oppenheimer House is one of Ponce's most distinctive residential structures. It was designed in 1913 for Doña Isabel Oppenheimer-de Santiago[a] by one of Puerto Rico's foremost early 20th century architects, Alfredo Weichers. Two years earlier, in 1911, he had built Casa Serralles, which today is home to the Museum of Puerto Rican Music. Mr. Weichers left Puerto Rico to study architecture in Barcelona, Spain, and returned to Ponce where he built various structures in the Spanish-Art Nouveau style. Weichers designed many of the mansions of Ponce's aristocratic society of his time. The Oppenheimer residence is one such structure. Architecturally, the house is the result of an artful combination of elements from the contemporary modernist movement and the simpler townspeople's building traditions used in the hot southern coast of Puerto Rico.",

The house was designed by architect Antonio Mattei Lluberas and built in 1893 by Angelo Cesari Poggi (xc3x81ngel Césari Poggi in its localized Spanish spelling) of the Césari Antongiorgi family, a Corsican-Puerto Rican family who was important in the development of the sugarcane industry of Yauco and southwestern Puerto Rico. The two storey manor house has a distinctive L-shape that borders the corner of the Matienzo Cintrón and 25 de Julio streets. The main structure is made of thick concrete masonry walls with wooden beams that support a flat brick roof. The wooden window designs became a typeface and inspiration for other private residences that were built afterwards in Yauco and beyond. The house is notable for the integration of various types of traditional construction techniques of time while also importing new techniques foreign in Puerto Rico at the time such as the use of forged cast iron in both the structural and ornamentation systems of the building. The cast iron was built and imported from the Saint-Louis Foundry in Paris. The architectural style of the building is eclectic and foreign in the island at the time of its construction, bringing inspiration from the French Creole designs which were famous in New Orleans at the time. The Cesari manor house is the largest urban property in downtown Yauco and is widely seen as an architectural landmark of the Corsican community of Yauco and Puerto Rico. The house was one of the earliest in Puerto Rico to be designed with a cast-iron girder and brick roof style. Its designer was architect Antonio Mattei Lluberas, after whom the house is often named, a rich landowner of Corsican and Catalan descent who studied architecture in Paris. He later became famous for his opposition to the Spanish control of Puerto Rico and became an independence revolutionary leader in the failed 1896 and 1897 revolts in Guayanilla and Yauco, respectively. The 1897 revolt in Yauco became notable for being the first time when the flag of Puerto Rico was raised in the island. Mattei Lluberas became exiled after these attempts and returned to become mayor of Yauco during the Spanishxe2x80x93American War.

In 1765, San Cristóbal was conformed by a hornwork surrounded by a dry moat, which gave continuity to the walls of the city, and at the highest point of it, there was a artillery platform, or Caballero de San Miguel (Knight of Saint Michael), for the emplacement of cannons. San Cristóbal derives its name from the hill on which the main defenses were built against the invasion of the city by land, although it also defended the north coast.

It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Lying on the northwesternmost point of the islet of Old San Juan, Castillo San Felipe del Morro is named in honor of King Philip II of Spain. The fortification, also referred to as el Morro or 'the promontory,' was designed to guard the entrance to the San Juan Bay, and defend the Spanish colonial port city of San Juan from seaborne enemies. In 1983, the citadel was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in conjunction with the San Juan National Historic Site. Over two million visitors a year explore the castillo, making it one of Puerto Rico's leading tourist attractions. Facing the structure, on the opposite side of the bay, a smaller fortification known as El Cañuelo complemented the castillo's defense of the entrance to the bay.",

Four days after its dedication, an earthquake seriously damaged it. Repairs were not completed until 1882. The 1918 earthquake damaged the vault so badly that it was replaced by a flat concrete roof; a vaulted ceiling of composition board was placed inside.

The plan is rectangular with three naves; the side naves are cut short to allow large flanking chapels, which occupy almost half the length of the church. The apse is semicircular, and has an unusual half-dome covering it. The facade is a triangular composition of three stages. The top stage, a short central tower, is a later addition, according to local architects and historians. Neoclassic ornamentation is used in an academic fashion on the lowest stage, but the other two show a less traditional use of bands and pilasters. The Renaissance-style windows are uncommon in Puerto Rican churches, but the central tower over the entrance is a common motif used throughout the island.",

The center is currently accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and it publishes La Revista del Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe. It was incorporated on February 28, 1968, by Pablo Casals, Luis Muñoz Marín, Roberto Busó Carrasquillo, and Jaime Benítez. However, it remained inactive and without organization until 1976, when Ricardo Alegría made a request before the Council on Higher Education of Puerto Rico to transform the center into an academic institution. With the CEAPRC, Alegría intended for a small institution that possessed an intimate environment, with intellectual growth and the promotion of a region-wide Caribbean emphasis as its focus. In her 2002 book, Carmen Dolores Hernández credited the CEAPRC (which she labels an \"experimental\" institution \"unparalleled in the island or the Antilles\") with breaking away from the \"cultural euro centrism\" of higher education in Puerto Rico. The curriculum was intended to be different from that of the universities. Puerto Rico and the Antilles received a central role with historic archeology, local literature and history in the spotlight. Besides numerous local sites, archeological digs were also held by students in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. Foreign professors such as Irving Rouse, Peter Roe, Mario Veloz Maggiolo, Sally Price and Lourdes Domínguez also collaborated with the CEAPRC. Students were allowed to take courses from other universities. On at least one occasion, a course was added due to student initiative.",

Following the acquisition of Puerto Rico by the U.S. government in 1898, as a colonial consequence of the Spanishxe2x80x93American War, the town was originally built as a company town by Ford & Co. (no relation to the automobile manufacturer), an American investment firm that developed a sugar cane manufacturing and export business, and its accompanying employee town facilities. It included 317 contributing buildings, 17 contributing structures, and seven contributing sites on 326 acres (1.32 km2). The sugar mill town and its facilities were constructed into separate living areas for white Americans, the American Zone, and those for Puerto Rican employees, The Puerto Rican Zone. On December 26, 1934, a series of protracted labor strikes began against the structured racial segregation and subsistent wages of the sugar cane industry, locally, and across Puerto Rico. The international price of sugar declined over the course of the 20th century, and by the 1960s, the company abandoned the town. At the time, its operation was taken over by local and national government, but with the continued decline of the international sugar price, the factory and its facilities were permanently closed in 1993. In 2020, American Express awarded funds for the restoration of the Central Aguirre Historic District. It was also listed on 2020 World Monuments Watch.",

The area where the refinery is located has been used for the growth and processing of sugarcane since the 18th century. The area where Central Cortada is located was originally called Estancia Descalabrado, owned by Catalan settlers named Juan de Quintana (from 1737 to 1789) and later Juan Cortada Manzo (from 1800 to 1865), who build the trapiche. The Cortada family kept operating the farm as part of their crop financing business, the Ponce-based Cortada & Cia. This company kept growing and acquiring new haciendas in the area, such as Hacienda Palmarito in 1868. The cholera epidemic of 1855-1856, which killed many estancia slaves, and the abolition of slavery in 1873 drastically transformed Puerto Rico's economy and impacted the sugarcane industry at the time. This period lasted through the Spanishxe2x80x93American War until the First World War. The Santa Isabel Sugar Company was founded in 1918 to build the infrastructure necessary to modernize and develop the sugarcane industry in the former estancia. This company was founded in 1918 and was owned by the Cortada family and shareholders J. C. Mc Cormick Hartman, Hugh Guillén, Isidro Abarca, Antonio xc3x81lvarez, Francisco Verges, George T. Parker, Leopoldo Cabassa, Antonio Alcaide, and Rafael Fabián. The director was Juan Cortada Tirado. Most of the sugarcane workers at this time were poor peasants who would come from the mountainous areas in search of work and alternative employment. These workers would often be called colonos (Spanish for \"colonists\") as the former slave-operated estancias and the communities that grew around them were now referred to as colonias or \"colonies\".",

The company was founded on November 2, 1937, by the brothers Valdés Cobián: Alfonso, Sabino and Ramón Valdés Cobián, in Mayagxc3xbcez, the largest city on the west coast of Puerto Rico. The Valdés brothers were following the example of their father, Don Ramon Valdés, who had founded the Mayagxc3xbcez Light, Power and Ice Company in 1910. In 1938, their first beer, Cerveza India, was released to the public. The company competed with two other native beer breweries, \"Real\" and \"Cerveceria Corona\" (Cerveceria Corona de Puerto Rico \"subsequently sold its trademark rights to Cervecería Modelo de México, which then launched Cerveza Corona as Modelo's Corona Extra).\" Alfonso, as chairman and president, successfully led his company converting it into Puerto Rico's largest beer brewery and manufacturer of canned and bottled soft drinks. In the late 70s, the brewery was forced to expand its portfolio and produce a lighter beer with less calories than their Cerveza India. Until that time, India was the only alcoholic beverage producing plant in Mayagxc3xbcez.",

This feature is known as westwork; (a west-facing entrance with towers, a vestibule, and a chapel). However, in the case of this church, its main entrance faces south. Curved steps lead up to the main entrance. The church, oriented from north to south, deviates from the traditional east to west orientation. On the west side of the church is a small parish house built in the same style as the church. The buildings are separated by a fence and a garden.",

It was built by the Vanderbilt family and it marked the beginning of high end tourism in Puerto Rico. Construction of the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel was begun in 1917 by Frederick William Vanderbilt, the son of William Henry Vanderbilt. He selected the prominent architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore, which had designed New York City's Grand Central Terminal, as well as the Biltmore, Commodore, and Ambassador Hotels. On 16 October 1919, the hotel, having cost a million dollars to construct, was inaugurated. It was suggested that the early Spanish Revival style architecture be used by Fredrick Vanderbilt. Capitalizing on the property's setting adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, the designers created a Beaux Arts-style structure with white walls, red tiles, French windows, lofty ceilings and other design details typical of the style at the time. The original roofing featured antique Spanish tiles sourced from Puerto Rico's older Spanish buildings. The floors and the public areas including the main staircase were decorated with marble and mosaics and the area between the ocean and the hotel building was developed to help the building withstand damage from the Atlantic coast. The hotel also featured a flagstone paved terrace. Giant pandanus, several kinds of bougainvillea, fruit trees and coconut palms could also be found in the hotel's gardens.",

Throughout the years, however, the conservatory has become a musical landmark in the Caribbean, providing advanced academic studies in various music areas to local students as well as international visitors. Since its inception, the conservatory has been under the administration of state government agencies, including the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (Compañía de Fomento Económico), the Administration for the Encouragement of Arts and Culture (Administración para el Fomento de las Artes y Cultura), and the Musical Arts Corporation (Corporación de las Artes Musicales, or CAM).

It is visible from the PR-123 but is accessible from a trail that begins adjacent to a Puma gas station located along PR-10 on kilometer 75. The cave and surrounding land are privately owned. The cave is a popular tourist attraction for Puerto Ricans as well as tourists visiting from outside Puerto Rico. An initial admittance fee for Saturday and Sunday visits was established by the owner of a nearby gas station, due to the location's popularity. The number of visitors is at its largest on both Saturdays and Sundays from early morning to an hour before nightfall. In January 2013, a daily admission fee was established, and later raised the following month. A boardwalk project was constructed from the gas station, leading up to around 200 feet into the trail, as well as a small parking lot atop a plateau behind the gas station. After a rise in popularity and visits, different admission fees were established for certain days of the week, providing necessary safety equipment for the 45-minute guided tour. The number of visitors is greatest on both Saturdays and Sundays from early morning to an hour before nightfall. Nightly tours are also offered on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Between February and March 2009, Disney Channel filmed Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie in Puerto Rico with scenes shot inside the cave as well as a land that sits in the Río Grande de Arecibo valley in front of the limestone cliff where the cave sits. In 2011, the cave was used as one of the settings for the 2012 British TV miniseries Treasure Island. In the summer of 2012, filming of the 2013 film Runner, Runner took place inside the cave.",

The national refuge also includes the forested areas around Monte Resaca, the highest point in Culebra. Portions of the island of Culebra were first designated a wildlife reserve in 1909 in accordance with an order proclaimed by then President Theodore Roosevelt. At the time, Culebra was administered by the United States Navy, and several areas were used for gunnery and bombing practice by the Navy and the Marine Corps until 1976. Portions of the Navy-administered lands were returned to the Puerto Rican government in 1977 while jurisdiction over the rest of the zone was passed to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. On-site administration of the refuge was established in 1983.",

There are six beaches on Culebrita, the chief one being Playa Tortuga (Turtle Beach) on the north side of the island. The beach is named for the many sea turtles that use the beach for breeding grounds and the surrounding waters for grazing. Sea turtles Tina and Ike call Playa Tortuga home. The other two large beaches are Trash Beach and West Beach. Because Trash Beach is located on the windward side of the island, debris is often blown onto this beach.

One example is The Sato Project, a large-scale rescue project which focuses its efforts on Sato Beach in Yabucoa.

Engineer Fossas was hired by Manuel, José and Amalia Vias Torrijos, owners of the lot, sons of the Puerto Rican lawyer and politician Juan Vias Ochoteco who, in 1908, had bought the building that previously occupied that lot. This emptied lot was formerly the site of a meeting house for a group called Sociedad La Filarmónica ('Society of the Philharmonic'), a scholarly club that was founded by Manuel de Elzaburú and Alejandro Tapia y Rivera with the intention of promoting cultural activities in the city of San Juan.

The stadium was inaugurated on November 12, 1932. Originally it was a baseball venue, and was built in an area then administrated by the U.S. Army. By the 1940s, a sector of the stadium, behind the baseball pitch, began to be used by some football enthusiasts. They played in a 100-metre length field known as canódromo (a track used for sighthound races). Some of the most notable Puerto Rican footballers of those times, started playing there.",

Farmers' markets may be indoors or outdoors and typically consist of booths, tables or stands where farmers sell their produce, live animals and plants, and sometimes prepared foods and beverages. Farmers' markets exist in many countries worldwide and reflect the local culture and economy. The size of the market may be just a few stalls or it may be as large as several city blocks. Due to their nature, they tend to be less rigidly regulated than retail produce shops. They are distinguished from public markets, which are generally housed in permanent structures, open year-round, and offer a variety of non-farmer/non-producer vendors, packaged foods and non-food products. The current concept of a farmers' market is similar to past concepts, but different in relation to other forms xe2x80x93 as aspects of consumer retailing, overall, continue to shift over time. Similar forms existed before the Industrial Age, but often formed part of broader markets, where suppliers of food and other goods gathered to retail their wares. Trading posts began in 1930s, a shift toward retailers who sold others' products more than their own. General stores and grocery stores continued that specialization trend in retailing, optimizing the consumer experience, while abstracting it further from production and from production's growing complexities.[citation needed]",

The original Boquerón battery was used by the Spanish to defend the city of San Juan from attacks by Sir Francis Drake in 1595 and George Clifford, the third Earl of Cumberland in 1598, who managed to destroy it during his attack. San Gerónimo became part of San Juan's first line of defense, along with the Fortín San Antonio and Escambrón Fort, while the last line of defense was the formidable Castillo San Cristóbal, which guarded the city entrance proper and also defended from land attacks. The San Gerónimo and San Antonio forts were pivotal in repelling the invasion by the forces of British Admiral Henry Harvey and Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1797. On April 17, 1797, their combined forces (64 to 68 ships and 7,000 to 13,000 men) landed in Cangrejos, approximately three miles west of San Juan. San Juan's military forces, which included, among others, the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico (Resident Regiment of Puerto Rico) and the Militias Disciplinadas (Trained Militias) were outnumbered by the invaders by a ratio of almost three to one. Admiral Harvey blockaded the San Juan Harbor while Abercromby established his operations headquarters in San Mateo parish overseeing all of San Juan and the Martín Peña Bridge. Abercromby's strategy was to take the Martín Peña bridge in order to block Spanish reinforcements from the south and bombard San Gerónimo and San Antonio from Miramar to gain access to and cross the San Antonio Bridge into the San Juan islet. British forces included the Royal Marines, made famous by their later defeat of Napoleon's troops in Egypt.

There, Oller demonstrated that he had an enormous talent in art and in 1848, when Oller was fifteen years old, General Juan Prim, Governor of Puerto Rico, offered Oller the opportunity to continue his studies in Rome. However, the offer was not accepted as Oller's mother felt that he was too young to travel abroad alone. When Oller was eighteen, he moved to Madrid, Spain, where he studied painting at the Royal Academy of San Fernando, under the tutelage of Don Federico de Madrazo y Kuntz, director of the Prado Museum. In 1858, he moved to Paris, France where he studied under Thomas Couture. Later he enrolled to study art in the Louvre under the instruction of Gustave Courbet.

It carries a broad selection of merchandise, sometimes in a small space, where people from the town and surrounding rural areas come to purchase all their general goods. The store carries routine stock and obtains special orders from warehouses. It differs from a convenience store or corner shop in that it will be the main shop for the community rather than a convenient supplement. General stores often sell staple food items such as milk and bread, and various household goods such as hardware and electrical supplies. The concept of the general store is very old, and although some still exist, there are far fewer than there once were, due to urbanization, urban sprawl, and the relatively recent phenomenon of big-box stores. The term \"general merchandise store\" is also used to describe a hybrid of a department store, with a wide selection of goods, and a discount store, with low prices. Examples include J. C. Penney and Sears. General dealers were established in the 18th and 19th centuries in many remote populated places where mobility was limited and a single shop was sufficient to service the entire community. Due to its close connection and confinement to its customers, general dealers often adjusted their sales offerings to the specific preferences of their community.",

In 1646, construction began on the Carmelite convent, through a petition by King Philip IV of Spain. The Monasterio del Señor San José de la Orden de nuestra Señora del Carmen (Monastery of Our Lady Carmen of San Jose) was founded in 1651 by Doña Ana Lanzós, a wealthy widow who donated her money and her magnificent residence (a large double sloped tiled roof) in the street that since then bears her name: de las Monjas. Historian María de los xc3x81ngeles Castro tells us that the delay in the arrival of a nunnery was due to economic reasons but also for lack of defense since the fortifications of the city were not yet complete. Three nuns brought especially from Santo Domingo served as founders. The building was expanded between 1854 and 1861 after the original building was torn down. Governor Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero personally helped to raise the necessary funds and inspected the work daily. Certain elements stand out in the facade of the chapel, beside the entrance, the pair of Tuscan columns, the two towers and the latticed choir arch. The frieze above the door is interrupted for a legend that never was placed. The building was closed from 1903 to 1959 and then sold. During its conversion to a hotel the two towers were removed as was the cross that identified the site as a convent.",

Its first Executive Director was sociologist and archeology PhD Ricardo Alegría, who felt that \"There was a need to counteract decades of harmful influences, which at times were openly contradictory to our cultural values, with an effort to promote those values. There was an urgent need to struggle against a psychological conditioning which had become deeply rooted in our colonial society, and which led many Puerto Ricans to systematically diminish anything autochthonous or anything that seemed autochthonous, while disproportionately valuing everything that was foreign, or that seemed foreign.\" It was in this social and sociological environment that the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña was born. The bill provoked fierce debate as, for some whose political views were in favor of the direction Puerto Rican politics had been taking in the several years prior to the debate, the bill touched on the very essence of the political status of Puerto Rico. Once the bill was signed into law, the controversy created by the new government institution did not end.",

The purpose of the xe2x80x9cquiebrasolxe2x80x9d is to filter the sun's rays towards the interior corridors. In 1973, the La Concha Hotel was united with the adjacent Condado Beach Hotel into one hotel, known as the Hyatt Puerto Rico. In 1976, management of the complex was taken over by Hilton International and the resort was renamed the Condado Beach La Concha Convention Center, with a huge convention wing built between the two existing hotel structures to physically connect them. The complex was later taken over by Carnival Cruise Line and renamed The Condado Beach Trio, before the La Concha wing was closed in 1995, followed by the closure of the Condado Beach wing in 1997. The government-owned properties sat vacant for years, and were finally severed in 2004. The convention center that joined them was demolished to build a public park.",

It consists of a small chain of cays, reefs, and islets, collectively known as La Cordillera (''the mountain range'') or Cayos de la Cordillera (Cordillera Cays). From west to east, the archipelago comprises Las Cucarachas islets, Los Farallones islets, Icacos cay, Ratones cay, Lobos cay, Palominos island, Palominitos island, La Blanquilla cay and islets, Diablo cay, Hermanos reefs, and Barriles reefs. The nature reserve covers about 18 nautical miles and almost 30,000 acres between cape Las Cabezas de San Juan in Cabezas, Fajardo and the Spanish virgin island of Culebra. With the exception of Palominos island and Lobos cay, which are privately owned, all cays, reefs, and islets in the small chain are protected by the marine reserve. The total land area of the reserve is 218 acres. The nature reserve is also important for local fishermen and eastern coastal municipalities, including Fajardo, Ceiba, and Naguabo, which depend on the reserve for their fishing industries. Although occasionally included as part of the reserve, the cays and reefs outside the chain that lie immediately next and parallel to the main coastline of Puerto Rico in Fajardo and Ceiba are not strictly protected by the reserve. From north to south, these are: Obispo cay, Zancudo cay, Roncador reef, Mata Caballos reef, Corona Carrillo reef, Ahogado cay, Ramos island, Largo cay, Piñeros island, Cabeza de Perro cay, Piñerito cay, Cabritas cay, and Cabras island.",

According to the story, Salcedo died in 1511, during a trip to Puerto Rico, when Taínos, under the command of Agxc3xbceybaná II (brother of the great Taino Cacique Agxc3xbceybaná) and the Cacique of Añasco, Urayoán, drowned him in the Río Grande de Añasco. Historically, two versions about how Salcedo was lured to his death have collided. Many books assert that the soldier had been told he'd be taken to a lake filled with Taíno women that he could have sex with, and, once there, he found not women, but men who then proceeded to drown him. The other version has Salcedo being offered a ride across a river by Taínos who carried him on their arms, and then drowned him and kept him for days, afraid he'd still be alive and waiting until they were certain he was dead. A third, and most accepted version of Salcedo's death says that the Tainos, fearing that the Spaniards might be gods, refrained from harming them. After suffering under the Spaniards for so long, the Tainos, by order of Agxc3xbceybaná, ambushed Salcedo as he was drinking water at the edge of a river. Fearing that Salcedo might resurrect after three days—based on their understanding of the Christian teachings wielded by Catholic priests—they sat around for three days waiting for Salcedo to come back from the dead, but all they saw was Salcedo's body rotting due to the heat just as they would. At that moment the Tainos realized that these were no gods.",

The state forest is located in the municipalities of Jayuya and Ciales. Los Tres Picachos State Forest was proclaimed and designated in February 16, 1999 through executive order OE-199-10. This proclamation was made thanks to effort and interest from local residents, the municipal administrations of Ciales and Jayuya, and the Guardianes de la Montaña ecological group. Its purpose is to preserve the ecological integrity of the forest terrains from urban development. The forest is found along two river basins: the Arecibo and Manatí Rivers, both flowing northward into the Atlantic Ocean. Other rivers found within the forest boundaries are the Cialitos, Saliente and Toro Negro rivers. The forest is particularly vital for the hydrological preservation of the Toro Negro River. The most notable geographical feature of the forest reserve is the Tres Picachos mountain which rises to an elevation of 3,176 feet (968 m) above sea level. Tres Picachos literally translates to three little peaks, and it is named as such after the three distinctive peaks found in the summit of the mountain.",

The hatchery is located at approximately 1,500 feet (460 meters) above sea level, 1.2 kilometers from downtown Maricao. The Maricao Fish Hatchery was established in 1937 on three segments of land originally measuring approximately 4 acres along the Maricao River on the northern edge of the Maricao State Forest Reserve by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) for the Insular Forest Service, and under the direction of Dr. Samuel F. Hildebrand of the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce. The original district consisted of six buildings and additional infrastructure built using stone and concrete as construction materials. The hatchery facilities officially opened in January 1938, and it represents the introduction of recreation fishing or sport fishing in Puerto Rico. The Government of Puerto Rico added an additional 2.75 acres for the hatchery in 1940, and by 1942, the expanded fish hatchery facilities included large grow-out ponds for breeding fish (particularly brown and rainbow trout) and sixteen smaller ponds for breeding of crustaceans. At a later date, another grow-out pond was added in the northern segment, west of the original ponds. Reconstruction of these facilities were undertaken between the years 1998 and 2000 after considerable damages caused by Hurricane Georges, which devastated the island in September 1998. At a later date, a visitor parking was built on a lot across the Maricao River. This visitors parking is not included within the district's boundaries.",

The beach is surrounded by natural limestone seawalls that protect it from the often violent swells of the Atlantic Ocean. These rocks form a natural shallow pool with calm waters that is perfect for families and children. Larger waves do occasionally reach this shallow pool during stormy weather leaving tide pools behind. The western side of the beach is located away from the limestone rocks and while considered more dangerous it can be ideal for surfing. The beach has recreational facilities such as picnic tables, bathrooms, showers, playgrounds and food kiosks. There are active guards on duty during daylight hours. The balneario and the water quality on the beach are also monitored by the Board of Environmental Quality (Spanish: Junta de Calidad Ambiental) and since 2018 it has been designated as a Blue Flag beach.",

The area where the forest now stands had originally been deforested and was the site of several quarries. The forest reserve was first proclaimed in 1998 with the intention of preserving one of the last green areas in San Juan as a secondary forest. The city is very densely populated and has lost most of its forests due to urban sprawl. This was done thanks to the effort of local residents, academics and environmentalists. In 2003 the forest was added to the San Juan Ecological Corridor management zone, also managed by the municipality of San Juan which designates the area as ecologically important as it forms part of the hydrological basin of the estuary of San Juan Bay. Between the years 1998 and 2005 the forest was used for research purposes for studying the impact of Hurricane Georges in the destruction and regrowth of the forest. The forest is very characteristic of the secondary forest ecosystem found throughout Puerto Rico. Some native tree species found in the forest are the yarumo (Cecropia schreberiana), the West Indian locust tree (Hymenaea courbaril), the Puerto Rican royal palm tree (Roystonea borinquena), and the pink trumpet tree (Tabebuia heterophylla) or Puerto Rican oak as it is colloquially known.

The caverns are part of a large network of natural limestone caves and underground waterways carved out by the third-largest underground river in the world, the Río Camuy (Camuy River). The cave system was \"discovered\" in 1958 and was first documented in the 1973 book Discovery at the Río Camuy (ISBN 0-517-50594-0) by Russell and Jeanne Gurnee, but there is archaeological evidence that these caves were explored hundreds of years ago by the Taíno Indians, Puerto Rico's first inhabitants. Over 10 miles of caverns, 220 caves and 17 entrances to the Camuy cave system have been mapped so far. This, however, is only a fraction of the entire system which many experts believe still holds another 800 caves. Only a small part of the complex is open to the public. The 268-acre park built around the cave system features tours of some of the caves and sinkholes, and is one of the most popular natural attractions in Puerto Rico. After restorations necessitated by Hurricane Maria, a destructive storm that struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the park re-opened on March 24, 2021. It then closed again from September 2022 until February 2023 due to Hurricane Fiona. \"Cueva Clara de Empalme\" or Clara Cave is the main attraction at the Rio Camuy Cave Park. A single chamber of this cave system has been developed for the public, starting in 1986. Regular cavern guided tour and audio tours are available at the site. Since November 2010, night tours called ECO NIGHTS have been organized weekly under special reservations. The tours start with the screening a short movie in a 90-seat theater, explaining the Rio Camuy Cave System and site safety rules, followed by a train ride that takes visitors into the entrance of Clara Cave. The huge chamber is 700 ft (212m) in length and 215 ft (65m) high. Once inside this chamber, visitors are able to see an entrance from the roof of \"Sumidero de Empalme\" that is 60m from the surface, as well as stalactites, stalagmites, unique formations and thousands of bats.",

It was built under the mayoral administration of Rafael Cordero Santiago, Mayor of Ponce from 1989 to 2004, at a cost of 2.6 million dollars, and inaugurated on 23 June 1998. It receives over 750,000 visitors a year. In September 2017 the boardwalk was damaged by Hurricane Maria and the area closest to the water was fenced off and off-limits to the public, but the rest of the facilities continued to operate uninterrupted. In January 2020, however, while still fenced off from the 2017 hurricane damage, the boardwalkxe2x80x94together with its adjoining recreational complexxe2x80x94closed when the area suffered severe damage from the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes and, as of 17 June 2020, it remained closed. By late 2020 arrangements were made for the merchants that operated from waterfront kiosks to reopen their businesses out of provisional facilities at a temporary location away from the waterfront while reconstruction of the waterfront area takes place. The Paseo Tablado La Guancha is located in Ponce's sea shore. Built in the 1990s, the boardwalk overlooks the Club Náutico de Ponce and has many restaurants and bars. It also has kiosks which sell food and alcoholic beverages. \"It's basically a boardwalk filled with many different local eateries. They mostly sell delicious 'fritters', like what we call 'bacalaitos', or fried cod fish [turnovers]. There are also 'empanadillas', which are basically fried meat- or cheese-filled turnovers. Apart from the food, the boardwalk is a great place to relax and take a light stroll. At one end of the boardwalk there is a lookout tower, giving an elevated view of La Guancha. You can see many big tarpons. These are not the prettiest, and do something really weird with their mouths once in a while. Just outside the boardwalk there are fun playgrounds for kids and a cool arcade. Ponce's beach is very near the boardwalk, you can even walk to it.\" There is also a marina where visitors can rent pedal boats and kayaks to explore the bay, an open-space stage for social and other similar activities, and an observation tower from where the Cardona Island Lighthouse can be seen. A 45-minute boat ride is also available to Caja de Muertos, a small island that features the 1887 Caja de Muertos Lighthouse and several beaches.",

The area was originally considered an important transportation and social center in San Juan. The Tapia Theater was built around this time and inaugurated in 1832.

The statue of Juan Ponce de Leon that used to be located in the center of the square was moved to Plaza San Jose (next to San Jose Church). Before its construction in 1897, the plaza used to be the eastern end of the defensive wall system that surrounded San Juan. It used to be the location of one of the main city gates, Santiago Gate (Spanish: Puerta de Santiago). This section of the wall was torn down in the May of 1897 as it was deemed unnecessary and it was considered an obstacle to San Juan's economic growth as the walled district was isolated from the rest of the modern city. The statue of Columbus atop its column at the center of the square caused people to start referring to the plaza as Plaza Colón rather than Plaza Santiago.

The main structure of the monastery still stands today, and it serves as the headquarters of the National Gallery operated by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. Throughout the 19th century, the lot was owned by the Spanish Army, which established the Ballajá Barracks, and later during the first half of the 20th century it was home to the US Army's Fort Brooke. The site and its surrounding buildings were abandoned during the second half of the 20th century, and by the late 1960s the entire area was in a rapid state of urban decay. After the institution of the San Juan National Historic Site as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and in an attempt to revitalize the area in 1986, the Puerto Rico State Office of Historic Preservation began a series of projects aimed at restoring the historic heritage of the neighborhood and reviving the economic, cultural and tourism industries in the area. As its current name describes, the modern square was built and finished in 1992 in time for the celebration of the 5th centenary (500th anniversary) of the European discovery of Puerto Rico and the Americas, during a period of extensive renovation and redevelopment of the Ballajá neighborhood along other important historic sites in Old San Juan. The square hosted a series of cultural programs including traditional arts and crafts, cultural performances and a carnival. It also hosted the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra, and a celebratory concert honoring Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández Marín, and other important figures of the cultural history of Puerto Rico. Some of the musical performers included Rocío Jurado, José Feliciano, Celia Cruz, Ruth Fernandez, Ednita Nazario and Danny Rivera.",

Of over 3,000 schools erected in Puerto Rico in the first quarter of the twentieth century, Ponce High was the largest, \"at a time enrolling more students than all the other Puerto Rico high schools combined\", and for many years enrolling more students than any other high school in Puerto Rico.

The Ponce High School building is \"among the most important public buildings ever built in Puerto Rico.\" The school is the oldest continuously-operating high school in Puerto Rico. The history of the institution dates back to January 1899. On 25 January 1899 a historic fire took place on the lot currently occupied by the High School. The fire is known as the \"Fuego del Polvorín\" (the Fire of the Ammunition Depot). At that time the lot was used as a U.S. Army ammunition depot. Today a register marks the location of the fire. In November 1899, the new American government authorized the establishment of a public secondary school in Ponce modeled after the American school system. In 1903 the Roosevelt Industrial School was built on land where the US military had its munitions depot that caused the fire. Five years after El Polvorin, in the 1904-1905 timeframe, a two-story building with 12 classrooms was built to accommodate the Ruiz Gandia Grammar School in the same spacious El Polvorin lot. The first class of Ponce High School students formed in 1902. As new facilities were completed, the students were moved to them. For the 1907-1908 school year another building was built called the McKinley building, and the Ponce High students occupied said facilities as well. Construction of the now-historic Ponce High School building on Cristina Street started in 1915 and the building was inaugurated in 1920.",

What is now Ponce Health Sciences University began in 1976 as the school of medicine of the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico. Soon after its first medical class in 1977, the university decided to not continue its medical program. In order to save the only medical program in the region, a group of lay and professional leaders in southern Puerto Rico acquired the school of medicine and established the independent Ponce Medical School Foundation, Inc. as a non-profit organization in January 1980. In July 1980, the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico (CHE-PR) authorized the Foundation to operate a medical school under the name Ponce School of Medicine. In 1981, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accredited the school to grant the Doctor of Medicine degree.",

Hurricanes in September 1928 and again in 1931, prevented the Ponce work to move forward once more, as money that had been obtained for the International YMCA Committee had to be used by the San Juan YMCA to help towards repairs to the San Juan YMCA building after these storms. In 1934, however, the YMCA of Puerto Rico became self-supporting.",

Before the arrival of the Europeans to Puerto Rico, Puerta de Tierra (along with Old San Juan) formed part of a smaller islet which was populated by the Taíno. Remains of a small indigenous fishing village have been found where the Puerto Rico National Guard Museum stands today, however most archaeological sites in the area have been destroyed and lost during the construction of the Muñoz Rivera Avenue and surrounding buildings. The Spanish began the colonization of Puerto Rico in 1508 when Juan Ponce de León founded Caparra, the first permanent settlement in the island, located in the southern part of the Bay of San Juan (today part of Guaynabo). This Spanish village was abandoned in 1519 when the Spanish founded the settlement of Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista (modern-day Old San Juan) across the bay. The area where Puerta de Tierra is located became critical for the settlement and the defense of the Islet of San Juan as it represented the closest part of the islet to the main island of Puerto Rico. This area, later referred to as El Boquerón, was separated from the main island by the San Antonio strait (today known as the San Antonio Channel).

This forest also protects a large portion of the Arecibo River hydrological basin. The remains of the lumber roads cut by the loggers and CCC workers have now become trails. Due to its value as an ideal representation of the karstic ecosystems in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, the state forest was designated a National Natural Landmark by the United States Department of Interior in 1980.

His father was a great preacher of the Calvinist faith and supporter of the Federalist Party. He thought it helped preserve Puritan traditions (strict observance of Sabbath, among other things), and believed in the Federalist support of an alliance with Britain and a strong central government. Morse strongly believed in education within a Federalist framework, alongside the instillation of Calvinist virtues, morals, and prayers for his first son. His first ancestor in America was Anthony Morse, of Marlborough, Wiltshire, who had emigrated to America in 1635, and settled in Newbury, Massachusetts.",

It is the final resting place of many of Puerto Rico's most prominent natives and residents. Construction began in 1863 under the auspices of Ignacio Mascaro. The cemetery is located outside the walls of Castillo San Felipe del Morro fortress, one of the island's most famous landmarks. The average height of the wall is 40 feet and the width ranges from 15 to 20 feet. It was named in honor of Saint Maria Magdalena de Pazzi. According to Rafael Rodríguez, Chaplain and director of pastoral services at the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón located in the Santurce district of the capital, the location of the cemetery is central to the Puerto Rican belief in the separation of death and life. The colonial Spanish government at the time construction of the cemetery commenced, viewed death with fear because it was a mystery. Therefore, they decided to build the cemetery to overlook the Atlantic Ocean to symbolize the spirit's journey to cross over to the afterlife.",

Situated between the eponymous main subrange of Cordillera Central and the Sierra de Cayey subrange, San Cristóbal measures 9 kilometers (5.5 mi) in length and reaches up to 750 feet (228.6 m) in depth, making it the deepest land canyon in Puerto Rico and the Antilles or West Indies of the Caribbean. Home to some of the tallest waterfalls and hundreds of species of flora and fauna in the island, the canyon is government-protected as a natural area since 1978, which came after the site was used as a land fill from 1954 to 1974. San Cristóbal and its northerly neighbor of Las Bocas Canyon are part of a larger canyon system belonging to the La Plata River basin in the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico. The San Cristóbal Canyon is mainly carved by the flow of the Usabón River, an eastward tributary of the La Plata River (Río de la Plata), which at approximately 46 miles (74 km) is the longest river in Puerto Rico. The river flow of the Usabón is fed by numerous tributaries, particularly the Aibonito and Barranquitas Rivers, which flow from the south and north of the canyon, respectively. These rivers are named after the municipalities they originate from, to which the Usabón functions as a natural municipal boundary. This river system, along with its wider hydrological basin of La Plata, have sculpted the canyonlands of the eastern Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. This process has created numerous waterfalls, some of which are the tallest in Puerto Rico. For example, La Vaca Falls (Salto La Vaca), at approximately 300 feet (91.4 m), is the tallest waterfall in the island. This canyon system is much bigger than the San Cristóbal and Las Bocas Canyons, and it includes other gorges and steep river valleys such as those of La Plata in Comerío and Arroyata in Cidra. This canyon is notable for being the deepest canyon in the West Indies with a maximum depth of up to 800 feet (200 m). Before the flow of the Usabón River, the area where the San Cristóbal Canyon is located was the location of a former fault line during the Late Cretaceous period. This fault line might have contributed to the inward flow of previous rivers by creating a depression next to a rise of the superficial terrestrial crust along the region which began the process of carving the gorge approximately 90 million years ago. This hydrological process caused the movement of sediments which today are evident in the rich diversity of soil types that are found in the area.",

This is a secondary or second-growth forest is located in the Gobernador Piñero district of San Juan, between the neighborhoods of Villa Borinquen, Caparra Heights and Borinquen Towers complex. The urban forest has entrances on Roosevelt Avenue and Ensenada Street. The forest extends to almost 70 acres and it is the smallest protected area in the Puerto Rico state forest system. One of the most distinctive features of the forest is the mogote on its northern edge which can be observed from many parts of San Juan and Guaynabo. The forest is part of the Northern Karst. The site of the forest was first developed for agriculture and cattle grazing and used to be a farm called Finca San Patricio. There used to be three mogotes on the site but two were destroyed to make way for the construction of the Villa Borinquen neighborhood and the Borinquen Towers complex. The third mogote still exists and it hosts a communications tower. The rest of the land was originally acquired by the US Army with the intention of developing residences for nearby Fort Buchanan. In 1962 the city of San Juan was experiencing a population boom and urban sprawl destroyed much of the original forest areas of the region. The area where the forest is located was not spared as if it was cleared to make way for more neighborhoods, and the only part of the forest to remain relatively untouched was that around the only remaining mogote. In 1960, the army left and abandoned the residences there and from 1974 to 1999 most of those residences were demolished. At the time the land was owned by the governmental Corporation for Housing and Urban Development (Spanish: Corporación de Renovación Urbana y Vivienda) or CRUV (today known as the Puerto Rico Department of Housing) and the land was intended to be developed to build housing of social interest but these were never built and the modern forest started to grow in the abandoned land. The area was considered one of the last green zones in San Juan and as such in 1998 the environmentalist group Ciudadanos Pro Bosque San Patricio, along with scientists and local residents, pushed to have the land be proclaimed a forest preserve. On August 3, 2000, the forest is proclaimed through an executive order and granted to the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA) to manage and preserve the secondary forest and its ecology. The goal of this proclamation is to preserve the forest for the purpose of recreation and scientific research. After being closed due to the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, the forest has recently been revitalized and it re-opened in April of 2021.",

As the medical officer in the general military hospital in Ponce, he was the first to describe and successfully treat North American hookworm in 1899.[citation needed] Because of his clinical investigations into the anemia caused by hookworm infestation, Ashford was inspired to organize and conduct a parasite treatment campaign. It cured approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population) and reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent.",

There he received his primary education and took interest in boxing. After gathering a record of 21xe2x80x931xe2x80x931 as an amateur, Escobar debuted as a professional in 1931 defeating Luis \"Kid Dominican\" Pérez by knockout. Early in his career, he moved to Venezuela due to the lack of opponents in his division. There he received an opportunity for the Venezuelan Bantamweight championship, but lost by points to Enrique Chaffardet. Subsequently, he moved to New York and began boxing in other states, eventually capturing the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title. In 1936, he defeated Tony Marino to unify this championship with the one recognized by the International Boxing Union, in the process becoming the third Latin American undisputed world boxing champion. After retiring, he worked as a spokesperson for beer companies in New York, before returning to Puerto Rico in the 1960s, where he resided until his death. He received several posthumous recognitions and his name was used in several sports venues and buildings. In 2002, Escobar was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.",

The theater building consists of the Lucy Boscana Hall and the Roberto Cole Cafe Theater. It was originally erected by Francisco Maymón Palmer in 1909. Maymón's parents emigrated to Puerto Rico from Italy in the 19th century. They settled in the town of San German. Early in the 20th century Francisco tried to build a theatre in the town of San German but was unable due to the existing religious culture then, which considered a theatre as a \"bad influence' on the local population. Maymón was an entrepreneur by vocation, having travelled to Europe and the United States in his 20s, and he would not be stopped. He moved to the nearby city of Mayaguez where he established himself as one of the pioneers of the industry of cinematography in the island of Puerto Rico, introducing this new form of Visual Art early in the beginning of the 20th century by showing silent films throughout the nearby towns and becoming the exclusive distributor for 'Nicholas Power Co.' movie projectors throughout the Caribbean islands. The 'Nicholas Power Company' was located in New York. With the help of his business partners Mr. Jose Rahola and Mr. Fundador Vargas, he imported movies from the Pathé Company in Europe, showing them in town centers (plazas) under the stars and at the old Mayaguez Municipal Theater ('Teatro Municipal'). The latter no longer exists, as it was destroyed in the 1918 earthquake that hit the city and was never rebuilt, hence the Teatro Yagxc3xbcez became the city's preferred gathering place for opera, plays, concerts, and silent movies. Francisco purchased the land where the Yaguez sits today around 1905. The construction of the first Teatro Yagxc3xbcez building began around 1907; The formal inauguration was in 1909. Materials such as the cement was imported from Germany, interior ceilings from Italy, tiles and carpets from Spain. An architectural jewel, the Teatro Yagxc3xbcez began as a neo-baroque style Opera House, years later turning into a silent movie theater. Incorrectly described as art deco style, however, the art deco movement developed years after the theater's first construction and later reconstruction.",

Then, in 1970, the Federal Government exchanged with the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico the Toro Negro section of the Caribbean National Forest for some forested lands belonging to the Commonwealth and located adjacent to the much larger federal lands at Luquillo National Forest resulting in the creation at Luquillo of the current El Yunque National Forest. In 1970, the Government of Puerto Rico's Departmento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales (DRNA) opened the Toro Negro Forest Reserve as a Commonwealth state forest and renamed it Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro (Toro Negro State Forest).",

It was formed in 1984 to preserve the last surviving sugar cane plantation line still in existence on the entire island, which was part of a large railroad system that operated around Puerto Rico prior to the 1950s. The railroad took passengers and sightseers across Arroyo's old sugar cane fields on a fifty-minute long guided tour that explained the industry and other historic aspects of it. Most of the original railroad right-of-way is former Ponce & Guayama trackage, which was in regular use up until 1990; a short 4-mile (6.4 km) segment became the Tren del Sur in 1984. Much of the original equipment abandoned on site also served as historic props along the route. After a temporary shutdown in 1988, former Arroyo's mayor Reinaldo Pirela obtained funds from Puerto Rico's government to refit tracks and the transfer of eight Plymouth locomotives from Central Aguirre's stock to restart successful operations in 1996. In 2005, the railroad was temporarily shutdown pending a major restoration project; although all work has been halted in recent years afterwards for unknown reasons. However, the Department of the Interior has plans to re-commission the railroad and extend the system further sometime in the near future. To enforce legal protection of the Tren del Sur, the Puerto Rico Legislative Branch first approved the Law 118-1995 and later the Law 212-2014 that superseded the 1995 law, but both laws failed to keep the train running.",

The custom house is located at the site of the former main port of the city of San Juan, north of the former Spanish Arsenal of San Juan, and next to the Las Dársenas and Immigrants' Square (Plaza del Inmigrante) and the Jose V. Toledo Federal Building and United States Courthouse. The large two-storey custom house is considered by the NRHP to be a superb example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. It is most notable for its size, its elaborate terracotta-ornamented central tower and its pink-colored exterior. The custom house was designed by architect and Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury inspector Albert B. Nichols, who also designed the custom houses of Fajardo and Ponce. It was built between 1924 and 1931 at the site of a smaller 18th-century custom house, at a critical location that used to function as the central business district of San Juan during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the site of the main port of Puerto Rico (today the main cruise ship port section of Old San Juan) before the construction of the new port (Puerto Nuevo) located along the southern edge of the Bay of San Juan. The Colonial Revival design was chosen to preserve the Spanish Colonial character of the area, as it incorporates architectural elements of the former Spanish custom house but also many of the Renaissance and Neo-Gothic elements popular in Spanish architecture of the time. The former Spanish custom house, which also housed a smaller warehouse and post office, was demolished at an unknown date during the first decade of the 20th century. This was done as a territory-wide project to enlarge and upgrade the governmental properties in Puerto Rico during the early 20th century. Construction was made by the Philadelphia-based Richmond and Kemp Ornamental Iron and Bronze and by the North American Wood Products Company of New York City. It was primarily used as a custom and additionally as a warehouse by the American Customs Service in Puerto Rico until the end of World War I. Additional modifications were made in 1957 and 1959 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while air conditioning was installed by 1960. The building is still owned and managed by the U.S. Customs Service.",

This period is bracketed on one end by the cession, on December 10, 1898, of the island of Puerto Rico to the United States by Spain as a condition of the Treaty of Paris ending the Spanishxe2x80x93American War, and on the other by the completion in 1931 of the major building and rehabilitation program undertaken by the U.S. Customs Service following World War I. While the Fajardo Custom House is the least imposing of the customhouses included in this multiple-resource nomination, it is still more impressive than those at Arecibo, Arroyo and Aguadilla, which were constructed during the same period but are no longer owned by the United States Customs Service. Its amplified Spanish Colonial-Revival style is in keeping with the somber economic import of its construction date, and the building provides a feeling of permanence and dignity in a minimally developed area.

Ten sheets of drawings of the Fajardo construction signed by Nichols (out of a total of twelve sheets) are in the San Juan Custom House files.

In 2009, the campus population was composed of 12,108 students, 1,924 regular staff members, and 1,037 members of the education staff. In 2013, the student population remained relatively steady at 11,838, but the instructional faculty dropped to 684. In the second semester of 2019 around 12,166 students were enrolled. By the end of the academic year 2022-2023 there were 10,071 students enrolled. UPRM has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since 1946. The University of Puerto Rico was created by an act of the Legislative Assembly on March 12, 1903, emerging as an outgrowth of the Normal School, which had been established three years earlier to train teachers for the Puerto Rican school system. In 1908, the benefits of the Morill-Nelson Act declared applicable to the island, fostered the rapid growth of the university. Evidence of that growth was the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts at Río Piedras in 1910 and the College of Agriculture at Mayagxc3xbcez in 1911 as a land-grant university. The founding of the institution is credited to D.W. May (Director of the Federal Experiment Station), José de Diego and Carmelo Alemar. In 1912 the name of the institution was changed to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts or Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mecánicas (CAAM).",

However, anyone is allowed to apply to this university. It is also considered the top bilingual medical school in the world due to its requirement for each admitted student to fully master both English and Spanish. In the nineteenth century, major health problems affected the Puerto Rican population. Anemia, malnutrition and parasitism were some of the most common conditions in children and adults. With the arrival of U.S. troops in 1898, the need for effective health plans to serve the population became a priority. With the change of sovereignty, anemia commissions were established in Puerto Rico. Thus began the development of what would become the Institute of Tropical Medicine, which was formalized in 1912. A consolidation of the former Institute of Tropical Medicine and other entities led in 1926 to the formation of the School of Tropical Medicine. Funds from Columbia University were used for the training of different health professionals in the island. At the same time, the school's professors conducted studies in collaboration with Columbia University physicians on tropical diseases hitherto of unknown etiology, or of high prevalence morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. In 1946 following the end of World War II, Columbia University canceled the money sent to the Medical School, which led to its closure. The legislature authorized a School of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico, into which the School of Tropical Medicine was integrated.",

Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf. birdwatching), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes. A study prepared for International Fund for Animal Welfare in 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource. Organized whale watching started in the United States, when the Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego was declared a public venue for observing the migration of gray whales; the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year, 1950. In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters. The industry spread throughout the western coast of the United States over the following decade. In 1971 the Montreal Zoological Society commenced the first commercial whale watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in the St. Lawrence River to view fin and beluga whales. By the mid-1970s, live captures for aquaria had reduced the orca populations in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington, particularly the southern resident orca population. According to their scientific chroniclers, in the 1980s commercial whale watching started becoming an alternative means of viewing and appreciating orcas. In 1984, Erich Hoyt, who had spent much time amongst the orcas of British Columbia, published the first comprehensive book on whale watching, The Whale Watcher's Handbook, which Mark Carwardine called his number one \"natural classic\" book in BBC Wildlife magazine.",

While there are several roads that lead to it, the most common point of entry is via PR-1, which becomes the Miguel Pou Boulevard, and then into the one-way Isabel Street, leading to the center of Ponce at the Plaza Las Delicias.",
